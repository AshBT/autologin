Introduction
============

Welcome! If you're reading this, then you're interested in trying out or 
using Team Hyperion Gray's AutoLogin application. AutoLogin can be used
both as a library or as a service that automatically finds and logs in to
an arbitrary website. This service gives you an easy way to do that without
having to find the login form yourself or build POST requests to login. You
can just specify any reasonable starting point to crawl a website (e.g. the home page),
give AutoLogin a set of credentials and it logs in for you, providing the authenticated
headers/cookies back to you for use in your own crawler or scraper. It can be used as
both a library or a service.
