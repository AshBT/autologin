Description: # autologin
        AutoLogin is a utility that allows a web crawler to start from any given page of a website (for example the home page) and attempt to find the login page, where the spider can then log in with a set of valid, user-provided credentials to conduct a deep crawl of a site to which the user already has legitimate access. AutoLogin can be used as a library or as a service.
